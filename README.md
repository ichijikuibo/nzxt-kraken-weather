# NZXT Kraken Weather

A simple weather web integration made for Nzxt Kraken Elite (might work on others).

Requires node 20+

start with npm install then npm start

Configuration allows for location select, temperture metric (CPU, GPU or liquid) and text colour. There is also the option of disabling weather animations to reduce CPU usage. Frame rate should be kept low 10-15 fps if using animations as they are not worth using 4% of your cpu.
